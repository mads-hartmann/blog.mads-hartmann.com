I have an ever-growing document where I keep track of all the small
(and sometimes major) changes I want to make to Emacs. Today I picked
a random item and had a go at it.

I'm a lousy speller and often misspell words in my comments and git
commit messages. I do have [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/FlySpell][fly-spell]] enabled to catch my mistakes but
I would prefer not to make them in the first place. For functions,
variable names etc. I have [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/DynamicAbbreviations][dabbrev-expand]] and my own home-grown
solution based on [[http://ctags.sourceforge.net/][ctags]] but nothing similar for words in the English
dictionary, so I spent 15 minutes implementing a simple solution.

The picture above shows the command in action trying to complete the
word "dino". I invoked `ido-complete-word-ispell` and typed in "sa";
the list shows the three remaining completions. I use
[[https://github.com/gempesaw/ido-vertical-mode.el][ido-vertical-mode]] to get the vertical representation of the
completions.

The code for command is shown below. It depends on [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InteractivelyDoThings][ido-mode]].

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun ido-complete-word-ispell ()
  "Completes the symbol at point based on entries in the
dictionary"
  (interactive)
  (let* ((word (thing-at-point 'symbol t))
         (boundaries (bounds-of-thing-at-point 'symbol))
         (start (car boundaries))
         (end (cdr boundaries))
         (words (ispell-lookup-words word)))
    (let ((selection (ido-completing-read "Words: " words)))
      (if selection
          (progn
            (delete-region start end)
            (insert selection))))))
#+END_SRC

To add a key-binding for any of the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; To enable it in a specific mode
(define-key markdown-mode-map "\M-?" 'ido-complete-word-ispell)
;; To enable it in all modes
(global-set-key (kbd "M-?") 'ido-complete-word-ispell)
#+END_SRC

Simple as that. Now I just need to figure out how to bind the command
to a specific key whenever the cursor is inside of a comment or a
doc-string.
