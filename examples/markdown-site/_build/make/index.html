<p>Make is a great tool. I like to quote myself</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I like to think of Make as a declarative string-oriented functional
programming language with very good support for executing commands
in a sub-shell. It&#39;s a programming language that happens to be very
good at creating build systems.</p>
