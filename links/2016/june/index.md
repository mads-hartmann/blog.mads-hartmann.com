# Links - June 2016

Here's a collection of some links I've stumbled upon in June 2016 that
I found interesting.

[Long Names Are Long](http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2016/06/16/long-names-are-long/)
by [@munificentbob](https://twitter.com/munificentbob).  This blog
post contains some interesting thoughts on variable names.

[AI, Deep Learning, and Machine Learning: A Primer](https://vimeo.com/170189199).
Great recap video of AI development throughout the years.

[docker 1.12: now with built-in orchestration!](https://blog.docker.com/2016/06/docker-1-12-built-in-orchestration/).
Docker released version 1.12 with seems to focus on orchestration.  So
far my only thoughts are: Seem cool, I look forward to read peoples
experience reports.

[Be Careful What You Code For](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWBZNxPzoUY)
by [danah boyd](http://www.danah.org/). Really interesting talk about
some of the considerations you should keep in mind when building IT
systems. She touches on lack of inspectors (as you have when building
e.g. a bridge or a skyscraper.), the environmental impact of e.g. the
storage requirements of your system, and how you systems might enforce
existing biases (with the example of systems used that is used in law
enforcement).

This quote at [10:33](https://youtu.be/UWBZNxPzoUY?t=10m33s) is
particularly is interesting:

<blockquote>
If you don't actively seek to combat prejudice and discremenatory and
biased datasets built into system you are build predijucial systems.
</blockquote>


[Ok, so I have all these Containers, what now?](https://youtu.be/7yhUbT40xLY)
by [Mandy Waite](https://twitter.com/tekgrrl) This talk from
[GOTO London 2015](http://gotoldn.com) gives a nice short explaining
of the origin of [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/) (Google maining
the applications in their data-centers.) as well as an introduction to
the main concepts in [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/).

[Instagram + Android: Four Years Later](https://engineering.instagram.com/instagram-android-four-years-later-927c166b0201)
by [Tyler Kieft](http://tylerkieft.com/).  The Instagram Android team
wrote a nice blogpost about their developer philosophy and how theyâ€™ve
evolved their code-base over the last 4 years while growing from 2 to
30 engineers. It has some very nice points and resonates well what I
think of as the issuu engineering philosophy.
