Famlydev has evolved quite a lot since I have [a talk][famlydev-talk] about it
last year. One of the biggest changes is we've loosened the requirement that
everything should run inside of Docker. Instead the developer should be able
to mix-and-match between having things running on the host, in docker, or in
our staging environment. To make this possible we run a proxy whoose
configuration I'll go through in this blog post.

## Background

I alluded to the goal in the in the teaser, but I'll spend a few sentences
clearing up the use-case a bit as all of this might be very famly specific üòâ

Here's a bit from an internal issue on our famlydev repository explaining the
need for the proxy.

Alright, so we introduced a proxy that's running on port `80` which routes to
the right services. However, this came with it's own set of issues, namely
that if you wanted to switch out a service you'd had to jump through a few
hoops. Here's another excerpt from the same issue.

That's because we use environment variables to tell the services where they can find each other (e.g. `FAMLYAPI=famlyapi:8090` and `famlyapi` would be resolved by Docker, and to use the local version you'd use `FAMLYAPI=docker.for.mac.host.internal:8090`, however NGINX doesn't support using environment varialbes in it's config so you'd have to update that as well ‚òπÔ∏è)

The **solution** we have up with to fix this is to use DNS for service
discovery and use NGINX upstream definitions with fallbacks.

## Service discovery through DNS

In order to use DNS for service discovery we have to make sure that all of the
relevant host names can be resolved on the host as well as inside of Docker;
luckily this was pretty straightforward.

### On the host

To configure the DNS resolution on the host we simply add a bunch of entires
to the `/etc/hosts` file. Here's what the famly part of my `/etc/hosts` looks
like:

```
127.0.0.1	famlyapi.famly.local
127.0.0.1	app.famly.local
127.0.0.1	api.famly.local
127.0.0.1	docs.famly.local
127.0.0.1	demo.famly.local
127.0.0.1	signin.famly.local
```

### In Docker

In docker we simply use Dockers [network alias][network-alias] feature:

```
version: "2"

services:
  proxy:
    image: nginx:1.13.3-alpine
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - ../etc/proxy.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
    networks:
      default:
        aliases:
          - famlyapi.famly.local
          - api.famly.local
          - app.famly.local
          - docs.famly.local
          - demo.famly.local
          - signin.famly.local
```

## Host precedence

We've defined a precedence for the our services. That is, something running on
the host takes precedence over anything running inside of Docker. For the
services in Docker the dev containers take precende over the ``production''
containers.

Here's the full NGINX configuration.

```nginx
# famlydevs proxy configuration - all traffic goes through this proxy.
#
# Notes.
#
# 1. Routing everything through docker.for.mac.host.internal
#
#    We have to do this as nginx won't start if there are DNS names in an
#    upstream definition it can't resolve during it's boot process.
#
#    Imagine you aren't running famlyapi in docker and we had defined the
#    famlyapi upstream with the following server definition
#    'server famlyapi:8090 backup' As we arent running famlyapi Dockers DNS
#    server can't resolve `famlyapi` and thus NGINX won't boot.
#    To work around this we expose a fixed port for each service and map it
#    out to the Mac, as it can resolve `docker.for.mac.host.internal` just fine

I hope this wasn't too niche üòâ
