This is an idea for a blog post about what local development and ci is like in the age
of serverless. The actors in these spaces don't seem to put much thought into the local
development experience.

Even Zeit.co who are doing extremely developer friendly tooling seem to also expect that you'd want
to deploy every change (of course not to production, but still).
