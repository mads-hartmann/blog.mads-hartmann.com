I'd like to write a blog post outlining the landscape of possible
solutions you have at your disposal when you want to abstract over
effects.

- Monads & Monad Transforms
- Free Monad
- Algebraic Effects

The following topics might be related but I'm not sure they're
necessarily needed to describe the above.

- [Tagless Final Interpreters](http://okmij.org/ftp/tagless-final/index.html)
- co-, free-, laxABC where ABC is a category
- Indexed Monads
