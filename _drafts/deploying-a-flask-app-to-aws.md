There are plenty of guides that help you build your first web application,
using a range of web frameworks, but I haven't come across a guide that helps
you deploy these services easily using Amazon Web (AWS) Services. This post
assumes no prior knowledge of AWS or any operations experience that is required
to run servers.

## Intended Audience

The goal is not to teach you the skills to the operations of web applications
on a large scale but rather give you enough experience so you can run your own
small web applications on AWS and give you a general idea about the kinds of
concerns you have when deploying web application and give you a few tools that
will help you deploy your own.

## Amazon Web Services

General introduction to AWS. Mention other provider (azure, google).

## Docker

Very brief introduction to Docker and mention why we're interested in it (It's
provider agnostic, it's easy, it's a good skill to have, even in other contexts
than deploying web apps)

## General concerns

* logging
* secrets / credentials
* monitoring
* automation

## Creating a deploy artifact

## Deploying your application

## Resources

12 factor app. Good introdcuction to the general concerns you have when putting
software into production
