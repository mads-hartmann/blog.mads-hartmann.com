Keeping a few notes here about what I'd like to learn more about in 2018. Then hopefully
I can check off some of the boxes as 2018 passes.

## Infrastructure

During 2017 I discovered how much I love working on infrastructure, automation and
related tools. However, sometimes I feel like I'm hitting a wall when I'm trying
to understand how various things **really** work as I haven't done much "systems programming"
previously. Also I never ran Linux on my laptop :O.

- Set up a tiny Kubernetes cluster running on three Raspberry PIs
  What I hope to achieve form this tiny experiment is
  - Experience setting up a couple of linux machines
  - Experience running some basic infrastructure myself
  - Experience setting up routing etc. so I can access the cluster from outside

## Writing

- Translate GADT blog post to Scala
- Write a blog post about Effects. Try to recap some of the many
  techniques that people use for extensible effects.
