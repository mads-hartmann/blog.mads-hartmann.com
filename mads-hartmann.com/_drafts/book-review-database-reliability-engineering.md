Database Reliability Engineering
Designing and operating resilient database systems
Laine Campbell & Charity Majors
2018 edition

I read a lot of the chapters a while ago and was struck by how much of the content applied to any kind of system, not just databases.

I really enjoyed the chapters I read. I should go back and read the rest and write up a review.
