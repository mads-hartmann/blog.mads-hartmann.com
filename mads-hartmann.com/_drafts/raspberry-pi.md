I'm trying to bring some of the hardware I have laying back to live. I
recently fixed my old MacBook Air 11" and now I'm trying to find
something useful to use my old Model 1 Raspberry for.

But before I can use it for anything I have to get it up and running
again. As I don't ever attend to attach it to a screen it has to run
headless.

This is a short guide on how I did it in case I have to do it again
some time in the future.

- Prepare the SD card. For this I downloaded the latest Rapberrian
  from XYZ and used Etcher.io to burn the SD card

- Enabling SSH access

- Making it join my WiFi after booting.

The last part is nicely described by [this answer](https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/10251/prepare-sd-card-for-wifi-on-headless-pi#answer-57023) on Stack Exchange and
this [blog post](https://medium.com/a-path-to-pi/adding-ssh-and-wifi-to-a-headless-raspberry-pi-3-fresh-install-54be6634716e).

So now I have a 2gb RAM laptop and a 512mb RAM server I can use -
let's see if I can find something fun to use these low-powered
comptuer for.
