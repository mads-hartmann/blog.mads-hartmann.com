Linux Observability with BPF
Advanced Programming for Performance Analysis and Networking
David Calavera & Lorenzo Fontana
2020

I read this book over a few days just when it was released. I remember finding it really useful but I should browse through it again and write a review once I've used BPF to debug production systems.
