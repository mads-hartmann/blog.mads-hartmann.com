I recently fixed up an old MacBook Air 11" from mid 2011. It has 2 GB of RAM
and a small 1.6 GHz i5 CPU ðŸ˜± I bought a new battery for it which gives it
battery life of XX hours!

I intend to use this as a "couch" laptop - for researching things and writing
blog posts.

But I can't help but take this opportunity to figure out how I would use this
for development.

There are many approaches - the simplest probably just SSH'ing into a more
powerful machine to do all of your development there.

But I'd like to research something different.

Things I think I need

- Shared Network Storage
- A K8s cluster
