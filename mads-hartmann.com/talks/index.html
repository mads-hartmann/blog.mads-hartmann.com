    <h1>Conference Talks</h1>
    <h2>At The Frontend 2016</h2>
    <p>This is a talk I did together with my colleague
        <a href="http://sorenvind.dk">Søren Vind</a> for
        <a href="http://atthefrontend.dk/">At The Frontend</a>.
        See the talk description below. It's available on
        <a href="https://vimeo.com/168448817">Vimeo</a>.

    <blockquote>
        At issuu we strongly believe that the only way to figure out
        if we are shipping a good product is to let our users tell us
        through their actions. Only by learning through data can we
        improve our product and user experience. Nobody would ever
        deploy a backend service used by millions and not invest in
        measuring, monitoring and tracking user behavior, performance
        and errors. Yet when the code runs on the browser, this is not
        unheard of.
        <br/><br/>
        In this presentation we'll focus on what, how, and why we’re
        measuring various metrics related to performance, quality, and
        feature usage in our JavaScript client code-base and how it
        helps us build a better product.
