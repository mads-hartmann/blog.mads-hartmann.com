title: Mads Hartmann - About
---

I love diving head first into production issues, especially the weird ones. When I'm not rummaging around in production I spend my energy making it easier to understand, and eventually more reliable. I have a fondness for **automation** and **programming languages**, especially statically typed functional ones.

I hold a masters degree in computer science from the [University of Copenhagen][diku] and I'm currently working as a Site Reliability Engineer at [Glitch].

For everyday random thoughts go to my [twitter feed][twitter], for some professional information check out my [Linked-in profile][linkedin]. For my open-source activities [Github][github] is the place to go.

I like giving talks -- being able to dwell on a topic and create a good narrative to make a subject more approachable is very rewarding. You can check out some of the talks I've given [here][talks].

I try to contribute to the open source software I use whenever possible. Here's some of the projects I'm proud to have contributed to:

- [Scala][scala]
- [Dotty][dotty]
- Tree sitter grammars ([scala](tree-sitter-scala), [bash](tree-sitter-bash))

Reach out to me on Twitter if you want to chat.
