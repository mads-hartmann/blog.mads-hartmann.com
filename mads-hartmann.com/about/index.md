## About

I'm **Mads Hartmann**, an experienced software engineer and tech lead with a focus on reliability. I love diving head first into production issues, especially the weird ones. When I'm not rummaging around in production I spend my energy making it easier to understand, and eventually more reliable.

## Experience

                As a Site Reliability Engineer I worked across the company to improve the reliability of the platform. I led projects to improve our observability, reduce the blast radius of code and configuration changes, improve our alerting through SLO-based alerts, and helped improve our incident response process. Our services were written in Node.js, hosted on AWS, and provisioned using Terraform.

                I spearheaded our efforts to automate and streamline our infrastructure. Specifically dockerizing our applications, setting up a proper CI pipeline, as well as setting up our Kubernetes cluster. I worked mostly in Scala with a focus on utilizing functional programming techniques.

                I worked as a fullstack engineer developing features end-to-end, which included making sure everything was performing well and ran reliably in production. I worked in OCaml, Erlang, Python, and Javascript.
