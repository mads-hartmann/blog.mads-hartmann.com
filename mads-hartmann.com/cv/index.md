- **2018 Dec - Now**: Site Reliability Engineer at [Glitch]

- **2016 - 2018 Nov: Fullstack Engineer @ Famly** <br/>
  Besides the usual work of implementing features and fixing bugs I spearheaded
  our efforts to automate and streamline our infrastructure. Specifically
  dockerizing our applications, setting up a proper CI pipeline, as well as
  setting up our Kubernetes cluster.

  I worked mostly in Scala with a focus on utilizing functional programming
  techniques.

- **2013 - 2016: Software Engineer @ issuu** <br/>
  During my time at issuu I worked in two different teams. In general I
  consider the work I did for issuu as full-stack and it was part of the job
  as a software engineer to ensure the quality of the product, pushing it to
  production and monitoring the performance.

  One of the key products I worked on while on the first team was a system for
  analysing user-behaviour based on JSON pingbacks sent from our various
  clients. This system was written in OCaml and consisted of an analytics engine
  for processing the JSON and aggregating numbers into a database and a DSL
  (parser and evaluator) for writing analytics reports used by our business
  analysts; the work I did for this team was almost exclusively backend
  development.

  The other team I worked in was responsible for the reading experience on
  issuu. I joined this team at its inception and our main goal was to write a
  completely new reader that would replace our previous Flash reader and the
  HTML fallback reading experience.
