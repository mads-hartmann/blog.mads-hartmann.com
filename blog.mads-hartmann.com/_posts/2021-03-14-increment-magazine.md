I had the pleasure of contributing an article to the [Reliability issue](https://increment.com/reliability/) of [Increment magazine](https://increment.com). The article is titled [Tracing a path to observability](https://increment.com/reliability/observability-distributed-tracing/) and chronicles our efforts at [Glitch](https://glitch.com) to gain visibility into our production systems and eventually make them more reliable. Give it a read and let me know what you think.

This is the first time I've had a chance to write something in collaboration with editors and technical reviewers and it was such a great experience. I can't speak highly enough of the editors and reviewers at Increment.

I wrote the article just after becoming a parent so it was primarily written between 4 am and 6 am in intervals of 30 minutes as I tried to get Aksel to sleep a bit longer. This meant that most of the time I handed in an incoherent bag of words which my editor [Rebecca Hiscott](https://twitter.com/rebeccahiscott) then turned in the lovely paragraphs and sentences you see in the final piece; if you enjoy reading the article it is as much due to Rebecca's efforts as it is mine.

The initial draft went through a few rounds of edits by their editor-in-chief [Sid Orlando](https://twitter.com/ohreallysid) before going into several rounds of edits with Rebecca, two rounds of technical reviews, a few more rounds of edits with Rebecca, and lastly a final review by Sid.

I was very much on the fence about whether or not to pitch a story, and I wouldn't have it wasn't for [Jorge Ortiz's](https://twitter.com/jorgeo) encouragement and initial discussions on what might make for an interesting pitch - thanks, Jorge!

Head over and [pitch a story](https://increment.com/submissions/).
