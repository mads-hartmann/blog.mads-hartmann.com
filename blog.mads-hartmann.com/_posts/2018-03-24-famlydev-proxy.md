`famlydev` has evolved quite a lot since I gave [a talk][famlydev-talk] about it
last year. One of the biggest changes is we've loosened the requirement that
everything should run inside of Docker. Instead the developer should be able
to mix-and-match between having things running on the host, in docker, or in
our staging environment. To make this possible we run a proxy whose
configuration I'll go through in this blog post.

## Background

I alluded to the goal in the in the teaser, but I'll spend a few sentences
clearing up the use-case a bit as all of this might be very Famly specific üòâ

All of our services can be configured through environment variables and we use
these to configure how the services can find each other - in production we use
Kubernetes' DNS based service discovery, e.g. we simply set `FAMLYAPI` to
`famlyapi-service` and kubernetes takes takes of the rest. During development we
used Dockers DNS resolver to achieve the same thing. Here's a bit from an
internal issue on our `famlydev` repository explaining the need for the proxy.

Alright, so we introduced a proxy that's running on port `80` which routes to
the right services. However, this came with its own set of issues, namely
that if you wanted to switch out a service you'd had to jump through a few
hoops. Here's another excerpt from the same issue.

The whole purpose of `famlydev` is that everything should just work‚Ñ¢Ô∏è so forcing
people to remember these kinds of workflows just to route traffic to a locally
running service isn't good enough.

Our current **solution** is to use DNS for service discovery together with NGINX
upstream definitions to encode a specific precedence when routing traffic to a
service. I'll cover each of these techniques in the next two sections.

## Service discovery through DNS

In order to use DNS for service discovery we have to make sure that all of the
relevant host names can be resolved on the host as well as inside of Docker;
luckily this was pretty straightforward.

### On the host

To configure the DNS resolution on the host we simply add a bunch of entires
to the `/etc/hosts` file. Here's what the famly part of my `/etc/hosts` looks
like:

```
127.0.0.1	famlyapi.famly.local
127.0.0.1	app.famly.local
127.0.0.1	api.famly.local
127.0.0.1	docs.famly.local
127.0.0.1	demo.famly.local
127.0.0.1	signin.famly.local
```

### In Docker

In docker we simply use Dockers [network alias][network-alias] feature:

```
version: "2"

services:
  proxy:
    image: nginx:1.13.3-alpine
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - ../etc/proxy.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
    networks:
      default:
        aliases:
          - famlyapi.famly.local
          - api.famly.local
          - app.famly.local
          - docs.famly.local
          - demo.famly.local
          - signin.famly.local
```

Alright, so now `famlyapi.famly.local` will route to `localhost` if resolved
on the host and will route to NGINX if resolved inside of Docker. So now we just
need to make sure that the NGXIN proxy routes the traffic to the correct place.

## NGINX upstream definitions

Now that all traffic goes to NGINX we have to make sure it sends the traffic to
the right service. To do this we define a [server block][server] for each
service and use [upstream][upstream] blocks to define a set of ports it should
try to connect to a specific service on.

The trick here is that we've defined a precedence for each "configuration" of a
service. E.g. running `famlyapi` locally on the host should receive traffic
before the `famlyapi` instance running inside of Docker (if one is running there
at all) - we use the port number to distinguish between the various
configurations.

Here's the full NGINX configuration - I've annotated it with plenty of comments
to explain some of the oddities of the configuration.

```nginx
# famlydevs proxy configuration - all traffic goes through this proxy.
#
# Notes.
#
# 1. Routing everything through docker.for.mac.host.internal
#
#    We have to do this as nginx won't start if there are DNS names in an
#    upstream definition it can't resolve during it's boot process.
#
#    Imagine you aren't running famlyapi in docker and we had defined the
#    famlyapi upstream with the following server definition
#    'server famlyapi:8090 backup' As we arent running famlyapi Dockers DNS
#    server can't resolve `famlyapi` and thus NGINX won't boot.
#    To work around this we expose a fixed port for each service and map it
#    out to the Mac, as it can resolve `docker.for.mac.host.internal`
#    just fine.

I realize this might be incredibly Famly specific, but I hope you still got something out of it üòâ
