- Gitpod to get ephemeral dev environments (or, cloud-based developer environments as we like to call them)
- Nix to handle installing system dependencies
- TypeScript 
- Turbo to handle a TypeScript monorepos
- NextJS for the "web app" (frontend, server side rendering, lightweight API)
- PlanetScale if I need a DB
