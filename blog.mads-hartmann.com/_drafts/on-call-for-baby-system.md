I've recently joined the on-call rotation for a completely undocumented, extremely alert happy system with no runbooks.

I share the pager for the Baby system with my partner, neither of us have gotten any proper instructions on how to maintain this system and both felt ill-equipped.

Three weeks in, and things are going better, but this is still a wildly mysterious system - we're learning new things every day.

The signals are vague, and how to deal with them unclear. Below I've documented the various signals and suggested a few run-books that might be helpful when the alerts go off.

## Signals & alerts

### Hiccups

This alert is harmless and can safely be ignored.

**Update** if this alert is firing it can be challenging to run the [nap](#nap) or [feed](#feed) runbooks ðŸ˜…

### Farts

### Urination

### Pooping

### Crying

### Excessive head-bopping

### Turning bright read

### Sneezeing

### Licking the air

### Barfing

## Runbooks

### Changing the diaper

**note** if you don't complete this within 2 minutes or so you trigger some kind of SLA violation and the Baby will either pee or poop on you; sometimes both. While this can make you slightly annoyed at your Baby system it seems to take some joy in it, which you can't but find adorable.

### Pacifier

**note** the Baby will eject the pacifier at the most inconvenient time. Be alert.

### Feed

### Nap

### Circular motions on tommy
