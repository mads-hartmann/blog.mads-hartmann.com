<blockquote>
utop is an improved toplevel for OCaml. It can run in a terminal or
in Emacs. It supports line edition, history, real-time and context
sensitive completion, colors, and more.
</blockquote>

<p>
I've found <a href="https://github.com/diml/utop">utop</a> to be a really nice toplevel for playing around with
OCaml. Espeically being able to evaluate code straight from an Emacs
buffer is wonderful. However, as soon as you start using it on larger
projects you will find that in a lot of cases it won't be able to
evaluate the code in your buffer as it depends on various <a href="http://opam.ocamlpro.com">opam</a>
packages and modules you've defined in your project.
</p>

<p>
Luckily there is a way to make utop aware of the opam packages that
you require and the modules you've defined in your project. This is a
short blog post that explain how. I also created a very small <a href="http://github.com/mads379/ocaml-utop-emacs-example">example
project</a> to go along with the blog post.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Loading the appropriate packages</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
If you fire up utop and invoke #use "topfind";; you will have a new
directive named #require that you can use to load your opam packages
into the toplevel (e.g. #require "batteries";;)
</p>

<p>
This is really nice and convenient when you want to play around with a
specific package, but if you use a lot of modules it's still quite
tedious (we use 24 in one of our OCaml projects at <a href="http://www.issuu.com/about">issuu</a>.)
</p>

<p>
Luckily utop makes it possible to put these directives (or anything
else you could type in the toplevel) in a file and have utop load it
on boot. If there's a file named .ocamlinit in the folder where you
invoke utop it will load the, otherwise you can specify a file path
using the -init option.
</p>

<p>
So if you simply create a .ocamlinit file which contains the
appropriate #use and #require statements then you will have
everything loaded and ready when utop has launched. See <a href="https://github.com/mads379/ocaml-utop-emacs-example/blob/master/Makefile">this makefile</a>
for an example of a Makefile target that generates such a file.

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Making utop aware of your compiled sources</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
There are two ways to achieve this. You can use the #directory
directive in the toplevel (or your .ocamlinit file) or you can specify
it as command line argument when invoking utop using -I &lt;dir&gt;.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Using it from inside of Emacs</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
I assume that you have Emacs configured properly so it can find
emacs-lisp files installed through opam.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(autoload 'utop "utop" "Toplevel for OCaml" t)
(autoload 'utop-setup-ocaml-buffer "utop" "Toplevel for OCaml" t)

(add-hook 'tuareg-mode-hook (lambda ()
    (merlin-mode)
    (utop-setup-ocaml-buffer)
    (set (make-local-variable 'compile-command) (make-cmd))
    (setq utop-command (concat "utop -emacs " (utop-extra)))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Inside of your <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Directory-Variables.html">.dir-locals</a> file for your ocaml project add the
following.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">((tuareg-mode .
    ((utop-command . "utop -emacs -I ~/dev/backend-similarity/.ocamlinit"))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now you can just open an OCaml source file and hit M-x utop to get a
properly configured utop toplevel buffer. Now you can start feeding code
to your utop session using C-x C-e. This makes it refreshingly easy to
play around with smaller pieces of OCaml code straight from your
buffer.
