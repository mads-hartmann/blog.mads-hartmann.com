I've used [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) in a range of
projects -- some large, some tiny -- and I've been happy with the
results. Over time, through colleagues and books, I've picked up a few
tricks and found a nice way to think about your Makefile(s). However,
it's only about a year ago that I really got Make under my skin and felt
I understood the power of Make and what problems it solves nicely. I'm
putting down my thoughts here in a way that I believe past-Mads would've
found helpful; it might have helped him appreciate Make a little faster.

If you want to get into some deeper aspects of Make after reading this I
highly recommend the book [Managing Projcts with GNU Make 3rd
edition](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596006105.do). Furthermore
you can always dig into a specific topic by consulting the [Make
documentation](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/index.html)
-- I will link to the specific sections where relevant but I won't cover
all of the features that Make has to offer so feel free to go explore.

## Why Make is Still Useful Today

Make is a programming language agnostic tool that provides a simple set
of abstractions for describing the relationships between the source
files in your project and the artifacts you wish to produce. This makes
it a very useful tool for automating the development work-flow as well
as the deployment pipeline of a given project. Ideally getting started
on a project should be a simple matter of executing a single shell
command which installs the required tools, configure the project and
build the required artifacts; nobody likes having to go through a 14
steps `README` in order to get a project up and running -- the same goes
for deploying your code to production.

However, having been created in 1977, Make can at times feel extremely
archaic. It's fair to assume that it must have been surpassed by more
modern tools. You are probably using a more recent programming language
specific build tool such as [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) for Scala,
[Leinigen](http://leiningen.org/) for Clojure,
[Rebar3](https://www.rebar3.org/) for Erlang,
[Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) for web assets, etc. These tools
solve the task of turning your source files into an artifact that you
can run and deploy. For this specific task I don't recommend that you
use Make, but rather that you should use Make to automate the use of
these tools.

In the next section I'll introduce Make in the way that I like to think
of it -- as a programming language.

## Make as a Programming Language

I like to think of Make as a declarative string-oriented functional
programming language with very good support for executing shell
commands. It's a programming language that happens to be very good at
creating build systems ðŸ˜‰

You write your Make program in a file called a `Makefile`. The purpose
of your `Makefile` is to describe a [dependency
graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_graph) of your build
artifacts and source files such that Make knows how and when to build a
specific artifact. The dependency graph is specified using rules -- this
is what I think of as the declarative part of Make. In order to specify
these rules concisely Make has a string-oriented functional programming
language that is mostly used to compute the value of variables that can
then be used when defining rules.

Once you have your `Makefile` you invoke Make like so

```bash
make my_file
```

where `my_file` is the name of the file you want Make to produce. Based
on your Makefile Make computes and traverses the dependency graph of
`my_file` in order to figure how and if it should produce `my_file`.

Let's start by having a look at the language used to specify the rules.

### The Rule Language

In your `Makefile` you declare your
[rules](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Rules.html#Rules)
using the following syntax.

```makefile
target: prerequisite1 ... prerequisiteN
	command1
	...
	commandN
```

The `target` is the name of the file you want to produce. The
`prerequisites` are the files that are required to produce the `taget`.
The `commands` (also known as the recipe) are the shell commands Make
should run in order to produce the target.

Image you have a project where you need to convert a
[Markdown](Https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) file to HTML.
The following rule would achieve this (assuming you have a program
called `marked` on your system).

```makefile
index.html: index.md
	marked --input index.md --output index.html
```

This tells Make that it can produce a file named `index.html` if a file
named `index.md` exists and that it can produce it using the shell
command `marked --input index.md --output
index.html`. Additionally Make knows that if `index.md` changes it
should re-produce the `index.html` file. An important note is that each
command in the recipe (is this case there's just one) should be prefixed
with a tab -- it's one of the many archaic aspects of Make.

A rule doesn't necessarily have to contain a recipe, the following is a
perfectly valid rule.

```makefile
build: index.html about-me/index.html posts/hello-world/index.html
```

This simply tells Make that there's a target called `build` and that it
should consider it satisfied if all the prerequisites are satisfied.
Targets like these makes it possible to provide a nice interface to your
`Makefile` -- you can now invoke `make build` instead of
`make index.html about-me/index.html posts/hello-world/index.html`.

#### Implicit Rules

With the rules you've seen so far you can imagine that your
`Makefile` gets a bit long as the number of Markdown files increase
as you have to explicitly describe the relationship between each
Markdown and HTML file.

```makefile
build: index.html about-me/index.html posts/hello-world/index.html

index.html: index.md
	marked --input index.md --output index.html

about-me/index.html: about-me/index.md
	marked --input about-me/index.md --output about-me/index.html

posts/hello-world/index.html: posts/hello-world/index.md
	marked --input posts/hello-world/index.md --output posts/hello-world/index.html
```

For cases like these you can define a [pattern rule](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Pattern-Rules.html#Pattern-Rules)
(one of many types of [implicit rule](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Implicit-Rules.html#Implicit-Rules)
that Make has) instead and get a nice and succinct `Makefile`.

```makefile
build: index.html about-me/index.html posts/hello-world/index.html

%.html: %.md
	marked --input $< --output $@
```

The
[pattern rule](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Pattern-Rules.html#Pattern-Rules) `%.html:
%.md` tells Make that it can generate an `.html` file from a `.md`
file of the same name using the body of the rule. The symbols `$<` and
`$@`
are
[automatic variables](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Automatic-Variables.html) that
expand to the name of the left-most prerequisite and the name of the
target respectively. More on variables later.

#### Auto-generating prerequisites

There are cases where managing the lists of prerequisites of a
target can become cumbersome and error-prone. A solution to this
problem is to generate prerequisites automatically for some targets.
This can be achieved using the
[`include`](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Include.html#Include)
directive.

The `include` directive tells Make to read another `Makefile` -- an
example would be `include foobar.mk`. Before reading the `Makefile`
`foobar.mk` it checks if there exists a rule that can produce
`foobar.mk`. If such a rule exists it will reproduce `foobar.mk`
before including.

This makes it possible to automatically generate a `Makefile` that
declares prerequisites and then import it. A tool that produces such
a `Makefile` has historically been called `make-depend`.

This is a little out of scope for this blog post so head over to
[Generating Prerequisites Automatically](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Automatic-Prerequisites.html#Automatic-Prerequisites)
to read more about this; I only mention it here as it's something
you are likely to need in a more complex build systems.

### String-oriented functional programming

So the dependency graph is specified through rules. Let's have a look at
the language features that Make has that enables you to write nice
concise `Makefiles`.

####  Variables

There are two kinds of variables in Make -- [simple and
recursive](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Flavors.html#Flavors)
-- they differ in the way they're expanded when referenced. There
are four different operators that can be used when assigning values
to variables.

**`:=` assignment operator** In the example `python :=
python$(PYTHON_VERSION)` the `:=` assignment operator will set the
value of `python` to `python2.7` given the value of `PYTHON_VERSION`
is set to `2.7`. That is, the right-hand side is evaluated during
the assignment of the variable.

**= assignment operator** In the example `python =
python$(PYTHON_VERSION)` the `=` assignment operator won't evaluate
the right-hand side but rather set the value of `python` to
`python$(PYTHON_VERSION)` and the final expansion of `python`
depends on the value of the variable `PYTHON_VERSION` when the
variable `python` is referenced. You can think of this as lazy
evaluation as you might be used to from using the `lazy` keyword in
[Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) (or if you've used
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)). Some good advice is to only
use `=` if you really have to. Otherwise stick to the other
operators.

**`?=` conditional variable assignment operator** In the example
`PYTHON_VERSION ?= 2.7` the conditional assignment operator will set
the value of `PYTHON_VERSION` to `2.7` unless `PYTHON_VERSION` is
already defined as an environment variable.

**`+=` append operator** In the example `foo += bar baz` Make will
append `bar baz` to the current value of `foo`. For simple variables
this is simply a shorthand for `foo := $(foo) bar baz` but for
recursive variables the operator will still do the right thing without
crashing in an infinite evaluation of `foo`.

There's a convention that words in variables should be
`separated_by_underscores` and that variables that a user might want
to customize should be written using `UPPERCASE` letters.

When you reference a variable it is expanded in-place -- In that
sense a Make variable is similar to variables as you know them from
templating languages such as
[jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/) or
[ejs](http://www.embeddedjs.com/). The syntax for referencing a
variable is `$(variable_name)`.

In adittion to the variables you define Make has a set of variables
that are called [automatic
variables](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Automatic-Variables.html).
These are variables that change value based on the rule that is
currently being executed.

####  Functions

Make contains a bunch of [built-in functions](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Functions.html#Functions)
and it's worth reading through them as it will make your `Makefile`
much more concise, especially the [File Name Functions](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/File-Name-Functions.html#File-Name-Functions).

The syntax for calling a functions is `$(function-name arg1, ..., argN)`.

It is possbile to define your own functions. A user-defined function
is really just a variable that is defined in such a way that it's
intended to be used with the built-in
[`call`](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Call-Function.html#Call-Function)
function. So when you're calling a user-defined functions the
pattern is `$(call variable-name, param1, ..., paramN)`

The following shows how to define a function. The arguments to the
function are available through the variables `$1`, `$2`, etc.

```
# $(call print-rule, variable, extra)
#   Used to decorate the output before printing it to stdout.
define print-rule
	@echo "[$(shell date +%H:%M:%S)] $(strip $1): $(strip $2)"
endef
```

There's a convention that user-defined functions use lowercase-words
separated-by-dashes.

## Example -- A Static Website

Let's see how all of this fits together. Let's create a Makefile for a
simple statically generated web-site based on
[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) files. You can
find this little example on
[Github](https://github.com/mads-hartmann/mads-hartmann.github.com/tree/master/_examples/markdown-site).
The project has the following structure.

    â”œâ”€â”€ Makefile
    â””â”€â”€ site
        â”œâ”€â”€ make.md
        â””â”€â”€ tools
            â”œâ”€â”€ osx
            â”‚   â””â”€â”€ homebrew.md
            â””â”€â”€ xargs.md

For each Markdown file we want to generate a HTML file with an
appropriate path and put it in a folder named `_build`. For the example
above the result of building the site should be the following.

    _build
    â”œâ”€â”€ make
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.html
    â””â”€â”€ tools
        â”œâ”€â”€ osx
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ homebrew
        â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.html
        â””â”€â”€ xargs
            â””â”€â”€ index.html

This can be achieved with the following Makefile.

```makefile
### User-changable variables.

BUILD_DIR := _build

### Variables

markdown_sources := \
	$(shell find site -name "*.md")

html_pages := \
	$(foreach f, $(markdown_sources), \
		$(subst site/,$(BUILD_DIR)/, \
			$(dir $(f)))$(basename $(notdir $(f)))/index.html)

# Alternative way to achieve the same thing as html_pages
html_pages_alternative := \
	$(patsubst site/%.md,$(BUILD_DIR)/%/index.html,$(markdown_sources))

### Targets

build: setup $(html_pages)
setup: node_modules/.installed
clean: ; rm -rf $(BUILD_DIR)
distclean: ; rm -rf $(BUILD_DIR) node_modules
print-%: ; @echo $* is $($*)

### Rules

$(BUILD_DIR)/%/index.html: site/%.md
	@mkdir -p $(dir $@)
	node_modules/.bin/marked --input $< --output $@

node_modules/.installed: requirements.txt
	rm -rf node_modules
	npm install $(shell cat $<)
	touch $@
```

Let's go through the Makefile step by step. First we define a single
variable that the user might be interested in changing (hence the
capitalized letters).

```makefile
### User-changable variables.

BUILD_DIR := _build
```

We then go on to define a variable that contains the path of all of the
Markdown files in `site` and the sub-folders of `site`. This is achieved
by using the very handy [shell
function](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Shell-Function.html)
which allows you to execute a shell command and use the result in your
Makefile. An alternative way to find all Markdown files could've been to
use the [wildcard built-in
function](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Wildcard-Function.html#Wildcard-Function).

```makefile
markdown_sources := \
	$(shell find site -name "*.md")
```

Before we move on let's make sure we got the use of `shell` right by
inspecting the variable using the `print-%` target -- the `print-%`
target is something I copy-paste into all of my `Makefiles` as it's
extremely useful for debugging `Makefiles`.

```bash
make print-markdown_sources
```
```
markdown_sources is site/make.md site/tools/osx/homebrew.md site/tools/xargs.md
```

Great, so we've successfully managed to capture the the filenames of the
Markdown files we want to process. Next up we use the `markdown_sources`
variable to create a new variable that contains the filenames of the
HTML pages we want to generate.

```makefile
html_pages := \
	$(foreach f, $(markdown_sources), \
		$(subst site/,$(BUILD_DIR)/, \
			$(dir $(f)))$(basename $(notdir $(f)))/index.html)
```

Here we're using some of the most commonly used built-in in functions.
We're using the
[text-function](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Text-Functions.html#Text-Functions)
`subst` to replace `site/` with `_build/`. We're using the [file name
functions](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/File-Name-Functions.html#File-Name-Functions)
`dir`, `notdir` and `basename` to get the directory part of a path, the
filename part of a path and finally the filename part of a path without
the extension. We're using the the [foreach
function](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Foreach-Function.html#Foreach-Function)
to perform the transformation on each path separately.

There's another very useful
[text-function](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Text-Functions.html#Text-Functions)
named `patsubst` which takes a pattern instead of a string to perform
substitution. Here's how to use it to provide an alternative
implementation of the variable `html_pages`.

```makefile
html_pages_alternative := \
	$(patsubst site/%.md,$(BUILD_DIR)/%/index.html,$(markdown_sources))
```

In this case I think the use of `patsubst` yields the clearest result
but it depends on the situation so it's nice to keep both approaches in
your toolbox. Let's have a look at the value of both variables.

```bash
make print-html_pages ; make print-html_pages_alternative
```
```
html_pages is _build/make/index.html _build/tools/osx/homebrew/index.html _build/tools/xargs/index.html
html_pages_alternative is _build/make/index.html _build/tools/osx/homebrew/index.html _build/tools/xargs/index.html
```

With the variables in order we go on to define the targets that we
intend the user to call; this is the interface of the Makefile.

```makefile
build: setup $(html_pages)
setup: node_modules/.installed
clean: ; rm -rf $(BUILD_DIR)
distclean: ; rm -rf $(BUILD_DIR) node_modules
print-%: ; @echo $* is $($*)
```

The `clean`, `distclean` and `print-%` are using a convenient syntax for
defining the recipe of a rule on the same line as the rule itself.

Notice that `build` depends on `setup` as well as `$(html_pages)` --
this means that if you were to run `make build` before having run
`make setup` Make will ensure the the `setup` target is satisfied before
attempting to satisfy the targets in the `html_pages` variable; it's a
small convenience this that means you have to remember fewer targets as
a developer.

Finally let's have a look at the rules.

```makefile
$(BUILD_DIR)/%/index.html: site/%.md
	@mkdir -p $(dir $@)
	node_modules/.bin/marked --input $< --output $@

node_modules/.installed: requirements.txt
	rm -rf node_modules
	npm install $(shell cat $<)
```

The first rule `$(BUILD_DIR)/%/index.html: site/%.md` describes how to
generate a HTML file from a Markdown file using a [pattern
rule](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Pattern-Rules.html#Pattern-Rules).
The recipe of the rule makes sure that the directory exists using
`mkdir -p` before generating the HTML files using the NPM package
[marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked). The prefix `@` of `@mkdir`
tells Make not to output the command when executing it. Notice we're
using two automatic variables `$@` and `$<`: The first is the name of
the target, the second is the name of the left-most prerequisite -- in
our case there is only one and it's the name of the Markdown file that
should be used to generate the HTML file.

The last rule `node_modules/.installed: requirements.txt` describe how
to install the NPM package(s) that we're using. The packages are
enumerated in a file named `requirements.txt`. First we remove the
previously installed `node_modules`, then we install the packages and
finally touch the `node_modules/.installed` file. The rule is using a
common pattern where we introduce an empty file (in this case
`node_modules/.installed`) which represents the successful execution of
the rules recipe. Here's the Makefile [manual
section](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Empty-Targets.html#Empty-Targets)
that describes this pattern.

Here's a quick demonstration. We're running `make distclean build` to
first get a completely clean workspace and then build to show how Make
installs the NPM package before attempting to generate the output.

```bash
make distclean build
```
```
rm -rf _build node_modules
rm -rf node_modules
npm install marked
/Users/hartmann/dev/mads-hartmann.github.com/examples/markdown-site
â””â”€â”€ marked@0.3.6

touch node_modules/.installed
node_modules/.bin/marked --input site/make.md --output _build/make/index.html
node_modules/.bin/marked --input site/tools/osx/homebrew.md --output _build/tools/osx/homebrew/index.html
node_modules/.bin/marked --input site/tools/xargs.md --output _build/tools/xargs/index.html
```

If we were to run `make build` again without changing any files then
Make is smart enough to know that nothing needs to be re-built.

```bash
make build
```
```
make: Nothing to be done for `build'.
```


If we change a file Make is smart enough to only re-build that single
file.

```bash
touch site/make.md ; make build
```
```
node_modules/.bin/marked --input site/make.md --output _build/make/index.html
```

And that's it.
