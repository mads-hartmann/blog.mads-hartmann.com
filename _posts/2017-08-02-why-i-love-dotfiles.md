Recently I've been spending a bit more time
on [my dotfiles][mads-hartmann/dotfiles] and I've really been enjoying
it so I wanted to try and put into words what's so enjoyable about
it.

If you haven't come across the concept of dotfiles before it's
simply the act of putting your personal computer's configuration into
version control -- usually with a bit of automation to help you setup your system
from scratch.

By putting your configuration in version control, and by automating
your setup, you're taking a step away from ad-hoc, perhaps a bit
arbitrary, configuration of your system and instead committing to a
more deliberate and considered approach. For me the key feature of
dotfiles is not about being able to setup my system from scratch
easily but rather that it motivates you to put a bit more thought
into how you configure your system.

It changes your attitude towards your system. When you consider your
configuration to be more permanent, that is, you expect it to outlive
your current computer, you're more likely to invest a bit of time
into making sure everything works the way you want, like writing small
bash scripts to automate work-flows. Over time this results in a
highly customized environment that works just the way you want it to
and where you know just how things fit together.

Another thing that I love about dotfiles is that they're inherently
personal. These are __my__ dotfiles. You are not trying to convenience
anyone else how to configure their system. It's your personal
preference - no apologies needed. This is very liberating to me.

I also ❤ the dotfiles [community][dotfiles] around sharing your dotfiles.
This might seem a bit contradictory to the previous point, however,
this is a very passive form of sharing. You're simply putting the
files out there for people to poke around in and borrow, and optimally
modify, to their own needs.

The act of copying and modifying brings me to the last point. I
absolutely love the culture that dotfiles represent to me. People who
can't help but tinker with their system till it works the way they
want it to. I'm a tinkerer myself, and a curious one at that, so
please go ahead and share your dotfiles so I can poke around and
steal from them.

my dotfiles are still quite young but I like to think that they'll
still be around in 10 years time, and hopefully they'll be much improved
by then.
