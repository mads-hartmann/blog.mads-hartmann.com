title: Mads Hartmann - About
---

I'm a software engineer with a fondness for **automation** and
**programming languages**, especially statically typed functional ones.

I hold a masters degree in computer science from the  
[University of Copenhagen][diku] and I'm currently working as a full-stack
engineer at [Famly][famly].

For everyday random thoughts go to my [twitter feed][twitter], for some
professional information check out my [Linked-in profile][linkedin].
For my open-source activities [Github][github] is the place to go.

I'm a big fan of **meetups**; I've been organizing meetups since 2010 but
recently I'm more inclined to give talks whenever possible. I like giving talks --
being able to dwell on a topic and create a good narrative to make a subject
more approachable is very rewarding. You can check out some of the talks I've
given [here][talks].

I love developer tooling. There's something incredibly rewarding about making
tools for your yourself. I try to improve the developer experience at the
companies I work at. I gave [a talk][automating-dev-envs-talk] about some of the
work we've done at [Famly][famly] to automate our local development environment.

Reach out to me on Twitter if you want to chat.
