title: Mads Hartmann - About
---

I'm a software engineer with a fondness for **automation** and **programming languages**, especially statically typed functional ones.

I hold a masters degree in computer science from the [University of Copenhagen][diku] and I'm currently working as a DevOps Engineer at [Glitch].

For everyday random thoughts go to my [twitter feed][twitter], for some professional information check out my [Linked-in profile][linkedin]. For my open-source activities [Github][github] is the place to go.

I'm a big fan of **meetups**; I've been organizing meetups since 2010 but recently I'm more inclined to give talks whenever possible. I like giving talks -- being able to dwell on a topic and create a good narrative to make a subject more approachable is very rewarding. You can check out some of the talks I've given [here][talks].

I love developer tooling. There's something incredibly rewarding about making tools for yourself. I try to improve the developer experience at the companies I work at. I gave [a talk][automating-dev-envs-talk] about some of the work I did at [Famly][famly] to automate our local development environment.

I try to contribute to the open source software I use whenever possible. Here's some of the projects I'm proud to have contributed to:

- [Scala][scala]
- [Dotty][dotty]
- Tree sitter grammars ([scala](tree-sitter-scala), [bash](tree-sitter-bash))

Reach out to me on Twitter if you want to chat.
